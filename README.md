## 🎯 Objective of the Task

- Learn the basics of AI and Machine Learning  
- Train a simple classification model  
- Test the model using real-time webcam input  
- Understand how data quality affects model accuracy  

---

## 🛠️ Model Details

- **Type of Model:** Image Classification  
- **Number of Classes:** 2  
- **Classes Trained:**
  - 🐱 Cat  
  - 🐶 Dog  

Each class was trained using multiple sample images to improve prediction accuracy.

---

## 🧠 Steps Followed

1. Collected image samples for both Cat and Dog classes  
2. Uploaded samples into Teachable Machine  
3. Trained the image classification model  
4. Tested the model using live webcam input  
5. Observed prediction confidence levels  

---

## 📊 Observations

- The model performs better when clear and well-lit images are used.  
- Background and lighting significantly affect prediction accuracy.  
- Providing balanced and sufficient data for both classes improves performance.
